Jay-Z and Beyonce made sure that their devoted French fans didn’t miss out on the World Cup final yesterday as they screened the match inside the Stade de France.

The power-couple brought their ‘OTR II’ tour to the stadium yesterday evening, itself the sight of France’s first World Cup victory in 1998.

But as the nation recorded a second triumph with victory over Croatia, massive provisions were made to ensure that fans didn’t miss out.

Photos posted on Twitter show the match being screened on huge screens, with thousands of French fans watching on in fevered anticipation.

“Watching France win the World Cup inside the Stade de France before Beyoncé and Jay Z is something I will never ever forget’, one fan wrote.

Another said: “Beyoncé and Jay Z played in Paris today. Opened the stadium early and played the World Cup final on massive screens. Then performed in French kits with 2 stars. Amazing.”
