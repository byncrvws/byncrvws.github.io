Beyoncé’s Coachella set in April will go down in history as one of the most epic performances the festival has ever seen. 

Not only was she the first black woman to headline the Californian music festival, but she also used the opportunity to celebrate the culture of black colleges, feminism, activism and her family.

And now, the artist has announced the launch of a new collaboration, which will see her Balmain Cochella outfits recreated by the design house, with 100 per cent of the proceeds being donated to charity.

While Beyoncé did release some merchandise on her website, including windbreakers and crewneck T-shirts, it was not based on the actual costumes she performed in, nor were they designed by Balmain, who created all of her outfits for the festival. 

Now though, fans can finally relive Beychella in all its glory by sporting the exact college-themed garb the singer donned during her epic two-hour set.

The new collection, launching at the Paris flagship store on July 13 and worldwide July 14, features three T-shirts and three sweatshirts offered in black, hot pink and bright yellow.
