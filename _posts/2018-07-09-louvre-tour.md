Everything is love between the Carters and the Louvre.

Beyonce and Jay-Z’s “APESHIT” video has racked up 61 million views and counting in just the past three weeks, in large part because the music video showing the power couple dancing among masterpieces such as Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo in the Parisian fine arts museum is a visual feast.

Now the Louvre is capitalizing on its new street cred by offering a free self-guided tour of 17 paintings and statues featured prominently in the first video off of the Carters’ new album “EVERYTHING IS LOVE,” including the “Winged Victory of Samothrace” statue that Beyonce vogues in front of while wearing a $140,000 Stephane Rolland wedding dress, and Marie Benoist’s “Portrait of a Negress.” The 90-minute self-guided audio tour (“Jay-Z et Beyonce au Louvre”) is currently only in French, but other languages will eventually be available. Or you can translate the tour in your internet browser using plugins like Chrome’s translate feature. The guide identifies each work of art and gives its historical context.

The Louvre wasn’t hurting for attention, of course. Eight million people visited the world-class cultural institution last year; one million of them (13% of overall attendance) came from the U.S., and more than half (51%) were under 30. The Louvre was the world’s most followed museum on Facebook last year with 2.7 million fans, and the most geotagged on Instagram.
