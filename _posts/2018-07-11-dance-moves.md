Beyoncé clearly got it from her mama.

Tina Knowles Lawson proved that her daughter isn’t the only one in the family with epic dance moves, sharing a new Instagram video of herself dancing to Beyoncé and JAY-Z‘s new single “Apes—” while on a boat.

In fact, the killer grooves extend to Knowles Lawson’s granddaughter as well. She was actually competing against 6-year-old Blue Ivy—  who she admitted totally had the better routine.

“This is my dance off with Blue !! She beat me of course !” Knowles Lawson explained in the caption. “We had to make up an original dance move. My awkward shoulder move was my made up dance 🔥.”

She added, “I know it’s wrong but my competition is only 6. She killed it though!!!”

The family day of fun also included a cheesy joke that Knowles Lawson credited to Beyoncé.

“Hello! I’m in the south of France, and it’s corny joke time!” the famous mom said into the camera. “Knock, knock.”

“Who’s there?” two voices off-camera, seemingly Beyoncé and Blue, responded.

Knowles Lawson continued, “Obama.”

“Obama who?” asked what sounded like Beyoncé.

Singing, her mother finished the joke, “All by myself.”

Knowles Lawson chuckled then added, “This is by Beyoncé. She gave me this joke,” as her daughter seemed to protest.
