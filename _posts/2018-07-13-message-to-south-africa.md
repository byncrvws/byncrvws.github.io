For years, Africans have lamented about how Beyonce refuses to acknowledge Africa as a part of the world unless she's sourcing creative inspiration for her projects but South Africans recently got a reprieve from those chest pains after it was announced that she would be part of the line up for the upcoming Global Citizen Festival set to take place in December. 

There have been various jokes about how she may just only perform four songs and leave due to the line up being so heavy but her fans have hope that she will do justice to her set as it will be her first performance on African soil in years. 

Earlier today, a promoted post from her Instagram account gave fans hope as she addressed South Africa directly, asking locals to download her latest joint project with her husband, Jay Z, titled "Everything Is Love."
