Earlier this year Skolopad took to Twitter to let fans know "they say I look like Beyoncé". Fast forward to July and it would seem that Jessica Nkosi shares the same sentiment — and so does her mom.

Taking to social media, the local actress let fans in on a conversation she and her mom had: "And my mom has always told me I look like her, like she literally did not know who Beyoncé was and she'd see her on TV and look at me for a long time and say, 'yaz wena ufana nalosisi," she said on Instagram Stories. 

This comes after a Twitter user told Nkosi she's "Beyonce's twin". And Nkosi agrees, replying: "Jokes aside... I do look like her... don't even hate on me".
