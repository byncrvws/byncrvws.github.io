The clever marketing ploy is a reference to Queen Bey's 2016 smash hit "Formation"

All hail The Carters! This past week, an ad for Beyoncé and JAY-Z’s surprise collaborative album, Everything is Love, was put up in Times Square. But the billboard didn’t take up just any old random spot in the New York City neighborhood — it was erected right above a Red Lobster.

The billboard ad’s placement is no happy coincidence. As any member of the Beyhive will recall, the R&B queen notably name-dropped the chain restaurant on her stellar Lemonade hit “Formation”. “When he fuck me good I take his ass to Red Lobster, cause I slay,” she revealed on the track, detailing how she chooses to reward her hubby for his above average services under the sheets. The line led to a 33% boost in sales for Red Lobster in 2016.
