Entertainers can be prone to exaggeration, particularly when it comes to wealth. In 2012, Wiz Khalifa told Forbes he'd earn $100 million that year (he went on to make $9 million). Rick Ross titled his 2014 album Hood Billionaire (he is worth less than $100 million). And Donald Trump has been telling whoppers about his net worth to this publication since the early 1980s. But Beyoncé? She seems to be right on the money.

"My great-great-grandchildren already rich," the songstress explains on "Boss," the third track on Everything Is Love, her new album with husband Jay-Z. "That's a lot of brown children on your Forbes list."

Beyoncé and Jay-Z's descendants will indeed be wealthy: the couple is already worth an estimated $1.255 billion as of this week's launch of another Forbes list, America's Richest Self-Made Women, with Beyoncé's clocking in at $355 million to Jay-Z's $900 million. 


The two superstars have built their fortune in different ways. Beyoncé tends to move more records and can draw larger crowds on her own than her husband, allowing her to frequently flirt with the $100 million mark in terms of pretax annual earnings. Jay-Z has created his empire by starting his own companies or buying pieces of others; he paid $56 million to purchase streaming service Tidal two years ago; Sprint's subsequent investment valued the company at $600 million.
