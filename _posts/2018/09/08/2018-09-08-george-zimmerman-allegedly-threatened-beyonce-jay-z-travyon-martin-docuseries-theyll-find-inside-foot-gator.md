George Zimmerman allegedly threatened Beyoncé and Jay-Z over the Trayvon Martin docuseries produced by the rapper.

Jay-Z served as co-executive producer on Rest In Power: The Trayvon Martin Story, a six-part series looking at the life and death of the teenager who was shot and killed by Zimmerman in 2012.

According to text messages obtained by The Blast, Zimmerman sent text messages threatening the couple to Dennis Warren, a private investigator who was involved with the series. Warren said he had received hundreds of messages and voicemails from the 34-year-old man, who was acquitted of Martin’s murder.

The texts are reported to have said: “And I’m bringing hell with me. Oh yea and tell Jay-Z he’s a bitch and his wife is a broke whore.

“If I see either of them in my life, they’ll find themselves inside a 13 foot gator.”
