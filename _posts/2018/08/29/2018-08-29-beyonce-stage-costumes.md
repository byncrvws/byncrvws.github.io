Beyoncé's onstage presence is such that you only need to see her spotlighted silhouette to know it's her. Since her early days in Destiny's Child, the singer has forged a distinctive personal language with her clothing choices, stepping out in ever-more challenging and stunning ensembles – from the militaria of 2013's Mrs Carter tour and the wide-brimmed hat worn throughout her 2016 Formation shows to the beaded sheer gown a pregnant Bey wore on stage while at the 2017 Grammys.
