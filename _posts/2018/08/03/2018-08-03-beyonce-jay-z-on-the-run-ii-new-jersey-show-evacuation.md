Tonight, Beyoncé and JAY-Z are poised to take the stage in East Rutherford, New Jersey's MetLife Stadium for the first of two OTR II tour stops. However, just before the show was set to kick off at 10PM, the stadium was evacuated due to an impending thunderstorm. Justifiably, the BeyHive was pissed and took to social media to document all the chaos. As of 10:30PM EST, the show is back on, but check out footage of what went down before that below.
