Aretha Franklin was on the minds of some contemporary hitmakers on Monday (Aug. 13) in her home town of Detroit.

With Franklin widely reported to be in critical condition and near death, Beyoncé and Jay-Z started their On The Run II Tour performance at Ford Field by dedicating the show to Franklin, with Beyoncé noting that, "We love you and thank you for all the beautiful music." 

Franklin and Beyoncé, of course were once at odds after the 2008 Grammy Awards, where Beyoncé referred to Tina Turner as "the Queen;" Franklin, the widely acknowledged Queen of Soul, took exception to that in a written statement afterwards, calling it "a cheap shot for controversy" -- though she did conclude the statement with "love to Beyoncé anyway." Less than a year later, however, Franklin came to Beyoncé's defense when the latter was criticized for lip-syncing the National Anthem at President Barack Obama's first inauguration.
