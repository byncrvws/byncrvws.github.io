Many fans are 'Crazy in Love' with the fact that power couple Beyoncé and Jay Z will hit the stage at New Era Field this weekend. It's part of their 'On the Run' tour. But something some people aren’t crazy about Monday is their concert seats.

Many people say their seats were switched without their consent days before the show.

Beyoncé and Jay Z will hit the stage at new era field this weekend -- a stop on their On the Run II tour.

While the power couple may have a song together called 'Upgrade You,’ many members of the Beyhive say their concert seats have now been downgraded -- without any real explanation.

“The week of the concert you mean to tell me that I am not where I thought I was, I can’t, this is not even the same view, that's not what I wanted. We were in row 10!” said Ashley Gilmer.

Ashley Gilmer says she paid about $430 for tickets back in March. Those seats were in section 131, row 10.

“We checked the account and the original tickets that we purchased weren't there anymore. It was just the two random tickets that were in two separate sections in two different rows,” said Gilmer.

Not only were the seats split up, she says she realized on Ticketmaster that she'd been bumped to the 300 level.
