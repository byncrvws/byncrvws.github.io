You may have as many hours in a day as Beyoncé, but the pop icon really makes them count.

Celebrity manicurist Deborah Lippmann told The Cut that she once got a call to pamper the “Halo” hitmaker at 1 a.m.

“I remember when I was dating my husband, he was over at my house one night when, and my phone rang at 1 o’clock in the morning, and it was Beyoncé’s people,” Lippmann told the publication.

“She was in the studio and she had a two-hour break, and they were like, ‘Can you come to the studio now and give her a mani/pedi?’ And my husband said, ‘What kind of manicures do you give at 1 o’clock in the morning?'”

Lippmann added that this is common practice for musicians, whom she characterized as “nocturnal,” and that she still finds it difficult to turn down an A-lister’s request for a midnight mani/pedi.

“Up until the last two or three years, I don’t remember ever saying no to anyone — ever,” she told The Cut. “I always figured out a way to make myself available.”
