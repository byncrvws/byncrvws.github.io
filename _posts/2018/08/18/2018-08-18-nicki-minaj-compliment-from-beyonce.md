Nicki Minaj appeared on SiriusXM Shade 45 to promote her new album Queen where she revealed her favorite compliment from longtime friend and collaborator Beyoncé.

Minaj recalled Bey's reaction to her 2014 VMA performance of "Bang Bang" with Ariana Grande and Jessie J, where her outfit change didn't go exactly as planned and resulted in an epic wardrobe malfunction. "One time she did say, which I thought was a really sweet compliment, she said that when I was almost on national TV with my boobs out on an award show because I couldn’t zip my dress up in time, she was like, ‘Oh my God I have so much respect for that, for the way you handled that. That was so professional. You didn’t miss your cue! You went out there with that dress the way it was…You were on that stage when your first line came on. You did what you had to do!’”
