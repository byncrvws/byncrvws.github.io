Upwards of 40,000 people were converging on the University of South Carolina’s campus at the tail end of weekday rush hour to see Beyoncé and Jay-Z perform the first concert at Williams-Brice Stadium in five years. Traffic was forecast to be so cataclysmic that a half-dozen area schools implemented early dismissal to get buses off the roads at typical peak times. Ultra-strict guidelines for what fans could bring into the venue (and how) had some fearing interminably long waits at the gates.

To top it all off, the evening forecast called for a chance of thunderstorms — exactly the thing that had caused a mid-show delay at Beyoncé’s last Carolinas show, at Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh in 2016.
