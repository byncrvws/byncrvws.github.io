The Comet faced criticism online from users over what they said was an inadequate number of shuttles before the concert and lengthy wait times.

The Central Midlands Regional Transit Authority — or COMET — offered round-trip shuttles to and from the concert at Williams-Brice Stadium for $3, with the State Museum and the Lincoln Street parking garage as its primary pickup and dropoff points.

Twitter user Stacie Cooper expressed frustration at seeing four buses in an hour and a half. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have been waiting at the lady and Lincoln street for 45 minutes only 1 large and 2 small buses have arrived. Please send more buses</p>&mdash; Stacie Cooper (@StaceCoop) <a href="https://twitter.com/StaceCoop/status/1032038730654208000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">21 August 2018</a></blockquote>

Concert-goer Allen Wallace said in a tweet that a bus “just pulled into the State Museum parking lot, saw hundreds of people waiting for the #OTRII shuttle, and left with no one aboard.”

Comet tweeted an apology to fans for the lack of buses just before 7:30 p.m. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We apologize for the lack of buses for the OTRII. At this hour of the day, we are taking people home from work.  Every bus not required for our normal service needs to the community is on the OTRII route.  As soon as those buses are available, there will be more shuttles.</p>&mdash; The COMET (@CatchTheCOMET) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchTheCOMET/status/1032045814263279617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">21 August 2018</a></blockquote>
