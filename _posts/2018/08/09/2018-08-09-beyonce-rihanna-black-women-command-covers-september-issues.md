Beyonc√©. Rihanna. Yara Shahidi. Tiffany Haddish. Tracee Ellis Ross. Lupita Nyong‚Äôo. Zendaya. Slick Woods. Issa Rae. Aja Naomi King. Laverne Cox.

In an unprecedented move, almost all of the cover stars on the coveted September issues of mainstream fashion magazines ‚Äì including Vogue, Glamour and Elle ‚Äì are black. 

September 2018 is clearly the month of #BlackGirlMagic, with the eleven black women listed above covering the fashion industry's biggest (both in physical size and importance) issue of the year.

Even InStyle, which featured Jennifer Aniston on its primary cover for the September issue, tried to get in on the tail end of the action by including Dutch Moroccan-Egyptian model Imaan Hammam on one of their subscriber covers.

It's a powerful statement on beauty, blackness and recognizing cultural tastemakers. Highlighting black women who not only run the gamut in skin tone, hair texture and build, but who are also leaders in their industries, is impressive. It's exciting and brings hope to a year that has felt like a dumpster fire more often than not.

Having Nyong'o, with her darker skin and natural short crop, on the cover of Porter magazine's "Desire Issue" or putting trans actress and activist Laverne Cox on Variety's cover would have been unheard of years ago. That's power.

"Until there is a mosaic of perspectives coming from different ethnicities behind the lens, we will continue to have a narrow approach and view of what the world actually looks like,‚Äù Beyonc√© said in her Vogue cover story, which was photographed by Tyler Mitchell, the first black photographer to shoot American Vogue's cover in the publication's nearly 126-year history.
