Beyoncé and Jay-Z actually did win two MTV VMA awards last night, unlike fellow nominees-who-skipped Taylor Swift or Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez. They were also up for Video of the Year, the biggest nomination an artist can get.

But the power couple chose not to attend the New York ceremony, despite being awarded Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction for "APES**T." Their reasoning may have less to do with snubbing MTV as much as it has to do with scheduling. Beyoncé and Jay-Z are in the middle of the U.S. leg of their On the Run II tour. They play in Columbia, South Carolina tonight after playing in Buffalo, New York on Saturday.
