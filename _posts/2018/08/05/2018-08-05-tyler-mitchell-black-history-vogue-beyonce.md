That black people in America – and the UK – are still, in 2018, on their “firsts” when it comes to achievements stuns me. Tyler Mitchell, a photographer and film-maker, is making history by becoming the first black photographer to land an American Vogue cover. He has reportedly been signed to shoot Beyoncé for the September issue.

Mitchell’s work is unashamedly black; he has depicted a utopia where black men could be as carefree as their white suburban counterparts, subverting a normally violent narrative by having them hold water pistols, while wearing a mixture of bright, soft colours and pearls. In a shoot with musician Kelsey Lu for the magazine Nii Journal, he pondered refugee narratives and wrapped her in a glistening gold foil cape, protecting a child in her arms.

I first met Mitchell on a Dazed and Confused magazine shoot with some of London’s finest black creatives, where he exuded warmth. He’d never been to London and was keen to find common connections both between me, his interviewer, and the rest of the black collective who were being shot on that bright afternoon last summer by black British photographer Campbell Addy. During the interview, Mitchell told me that he accidentally fell into photography and filming when he was 15 through skateboarding. 

I was excited to learn that he had been given the opportunity to work with Beyoncé but was frustrated at the indirect way it came about, needing a megastar intervention.

“The reason a 23-year-old black photographer is photographing Beyoncé for the cover of Vogue is because Beyoncé used her power and influence to get him that assignment,” a source close to Vogue told HuffPost’s Yashar Ali, who broke the story. Anna Wintour, Vogue’s editor-in-chief and artistic director, having failed to hire a single black photographer to shoot a cover in her 30-year tenure, has given unprecedented control to the singer for the flagship issue.

The publication doesn’t have a good track record when it comes to representing black people on the cover. Although new editor-in-chief Edward Enninful is swiftly rectifying the problem in the UK, British Vogue once went over 12 years, from 2002 until 2015, without a black person gracing its cover.

As Mitchell once said: “We need to use our art to wake people up right now.” If he stays true to that ideology, his Beyoncé cover should be the beginning of the end for the era of firsts.
