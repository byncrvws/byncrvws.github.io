Azealia Banks is blasting Beyoncé once again.

On Friday night, the Harlem rapper reiterated her claims that Bey tries to “steal from talented women.” Banks made the accusations in a couple of Instagram stories, in which she criticized Mrs. Carter for lacking originality. The controversial rapper claimed Bey used stolen choreography that was originally featured in her “Count Contessa” music video. The posts came after JAY-Z and Beyoncé finished their two-night On the Run II tour stint at MetLife Stadium.

"I realised that my ex dancer Ashanti choreographed for Beyoncé and stole the original choreography @gypjaq made for count contessa,” Banks wrote, before suggesting Beyoncé give her a job. “Beyoncé needs to get over herself and just hire me.”

But Banks insists she isn’t the only artist who’s been ripped off by Bey. She goes on to say that the Lemonade singer has pushed a message of female empowerment, but has always tried to “steal from talented women and try to out do them” without success.

“I really hope [Beyoncé] gets real with herself soon and humbles herself enough to accept the visions and full projects women who admire her put together FOR HER,” Banks continued. “Like we don't need anymore Beyoncé thot moments...I have NO CLUE why she wants to be a regular bitch.”
