While the rest of us mere mortals have been accessorizing with hoop earrings, Beyoncé is out here living in the year 3008 and wearing Slinkys as earrings.

Yes, Queen Bey took the toy you spent hours watching go down the stairs as a child and transformed it into a piece of jewelry like only a real icon can. (Meanwhile, when I tried to accessorize with my Slinky in the first grade, nobody called me iconic, but whatever.)

Taking a break from her 'On The Run II' tour, the Lemonade singer stepped out in New York wearing a suited up look that she accessorized with gold Slinky-inspired earrings by Y/Project. Along with the playful jewelry, she also accessorized with a hot pink bag (that could potentially double as a giant flask), tortoise sunglasses, and a sky-high braided half ponytail.
