Of all the wisdom Beyoncé imparted in her "Vogue" essay, released Monday to accompany her September issue cover of the magazine, one four-letter acronym has sparked celebration among readers.

In the portion of her essay in which she wrote about the changes her body underwent post-pregnancy, Bey name-dropped her "FUPA," an acronym that refers to her "fat upper pubic area." While some alternate definitions of the phrase are more NSFW, they all are used to describe a layer of fat on the body's lower abdominal area.

"To this day my arms, shoulders, breasts, and thighs are fuller," she told "Vogue." "I have a little mommy pouch, and I’m in no rush to get rid of it. I think it’s real. Whenever I’m ready to get a six-pack, I will go into beast zone and work my (butt) off until I have it. But right now, my little FUPA and I feel like we are meant to be."

Social media was overjoyed by Beyoncé's FUPA love, with actress Laverne Cox tweeting, "This quote made me cry."

"Beyoncé likes her FUPA so guess who’s canceling his gym membership!" another Twitter user proclaimed. 

Others celebrated Bey's statement as her implicit denial of the recent tabloid rumors speculating that she is pregnant again.
