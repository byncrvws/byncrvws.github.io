R&B diva Beyoncé Knowles-Carter flaunted substantial cleavage during a hot dinner date with her husband of a decade, Jay-Z, in his native Manhattan on Monday.

The 36-year-old mother-of-three - who relies on stylist Marni Senofonte - paired her pale plunging blazer with matching shorts, high-heeled slingbacks, a pink purse, and Slinky-style earrings.

The 48-year-old rap mogul (born Shawn Carter) sported an athleisure ensemble of black track pants, an Adidas baseball cap, navy Puma shoes, and a matching long-sleeved top.

The Houston-born Texan's street sighting came the day after she treated their daughter Blue Ivy to a showing of Disney's Frozen on Broadway where she met the cast backstage at the St. James Theatre.

'Beyoncé was overheard telling her girlfriend that watching the show about two sisters who make sacrifices to save each other made her miss her sister [Solange],' a source told Page Six.
