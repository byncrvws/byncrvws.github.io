Beyoncé has said she is descended from a slaveowner, in a new interview with Vogue in which she also speaks candidly about race, body image, her children and her creativity.

“I researched my ancestry recently and learned that I come from a slaveowner who fell in love with and married a slave,” she said. “I had to process that revelation over time. I questioned what it meant and tried to put it into perspective. I now believe it’s why God blessed me with my twins. Male and female energy was able to coexist and grow in my blood for the first time. I pray that I am able to break the generational curses in my family and that my children will have less complicated lives.”

The 36-year-old said that her family has a “lineage of broken male-female relationships, abuse of power, and mistrust. Only when I saw that clearly was I able to resolve those conflicts in my own relationship” – an allusion to the marital discord between her and husband Jay-Z, who it is rumoured was unfaithful. She described him as “a soldier and such a strong support system for me” in the wake of giving birth to their twins, Rumi and Sir.

She revealed that they were born via an emergency caesarian section, and that unlike after the birth of her first child Blue Ivy, she resisted pressure to follow “the things society said about how my body should look” and “embraced being curvier”.
