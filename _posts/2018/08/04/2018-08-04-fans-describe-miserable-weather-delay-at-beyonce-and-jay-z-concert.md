Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s On the Run II Tour had fans running out of MetLife Stadium Thursday night after the entire venue was evacuated over a thunderstorm.

Around 50,000 fans — some of whom had paid up to $400 for tickets — were forced to wait for hours after officials told them to move inside.

“Bey and Jay-Z were already over an hour past their original start time, but at 9:45 we were evacuated by the fire marshal and at 10:30 I left to go home before they even got onstage,” a concertgoer told us of the East Rutherford, NJ, show. “I had to get back into the city to walk the dog!”

Another ticket holder said people got hot and bothered while waiting inside the New Jersey stadium for the queen and king of music, calling it “uncomfortable” and “increasingly humid.”

A source added that things got even stickier as MetLife bosses extended the alcohol cutoff — which led to a pretty rowdy crowd.

The audience included Lin-Manuel Miranda, who tweeted: “We were this close to leaving during the storm evacuation and watching Fade To Black on DVD at home—which is what we did on OUR FIRST DATE Y’ALL. Thank Beyonce we stayed.”

Another source told us: “It was clear that something was up when DJ Khaled’s opening set kept going on and on, as the MetLife audience grew impatient for Bey and Jay to hit the stage.”

The pair eventually walked on at 11:08 p.m., cranking out hits “Crazy in Love,” “Drunk in Love,” “Formation” and “99 Problems.” (See photo below.) They wrapped at 1:29 a.m. Friday, with Bey thanking the crowd for “not letting the rain stop the night.”
