The Apes**t singer was pranked into thinking she was taking a selfie but eventually realised it was a video. Classic.

The 36-year-old was visited backstage on her On The Run II tour by longtime friend and celebrity make-up artist Mally Roncal. After no doubt enjoying a good catch-up, Mally got Beyonce to pose for what the singer believed was a selfie.

Putting on her best pout, queen Bey throws a fierce stare at the camera as Mally gushes: ‘Who’s the most beautiful woman on the planet?’

After a few seconds, Beyonce realises what her friend is up to and exclaims in surprise: ‘Oh, wait, this is a video?’

Mally then bursts into laughter as Bey says: ‘Sorry, I’m over here making fish lips!’ After a member of staff informs the ever-busy singer that it’s time to get ready for the performance, she returns to the camera briefly and tells Mally: ‘Love you.’

In the accompanying caption, Mally wrote a gushing tribute to Beyonce and revealed that she and the singer have been close friends for nearly two decades.

The make-up artist wrote: ‘@Beyonce I love you. There are no words to describe how priceless our friendship is to me.
