 The 2018 wedding season is coming to a close, punctuated by some classic viral drama between a bride and her ousted bridesmaid. In the run-up to Labor Day, the official marker of the end of the season of love, beleaguered friends and family across the nation will no doubt play witness to countless “rustic chic” ceremonies lit by the warm glow of candles in Mason jars and first dances soundtracked to staples like Etta James’ “At Last” or Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud.”

Cheesy schmaltz is a playlist prerequisite for many couples. But the recent circulation of an “ultimate playlist of banned wedding songs” compiled by FiveThirtyEight proved that the question of which songs are wedding anthems and which are anathema is up for spirited debate. Songs listed as most likely to be banned include some tracks that objectively deserve to be retired (Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines”) and straight-up bangers apparently banned by people who hate fun (“Love Shack”, “Dancing Queen,” “Single Ladies”). Inspired by this list, we polled Slatesters on the songs and artists they banned from their own weddings. In our small sample, the Black Eyed Peas strangely came in a decisive first place, although the staffer who had reason to ban the Game of Thrones theme song might have won best story. 

## All Beyoncé Except “Love on Top”

I am currently planning my wedding, and we’ve made the controversial move of banning all Beyoncé songs aside from “Love on Top.” The decision was made after a negotiation with my partner, who would have placed no upper limit on Beyoncé songs. But I’d prefer to have only one Beyoncé song since many weddings have, like, eight—and in part because of the climactic key changes, I like that one best among her up-tempo jams. (Up-tempo Beyoncé jams are rather rare, I’d say! Don’t @ me, I find Beyoncé a little hard to dance to!) With only five to six(?) hours of dancing at the biggest party we’ve ever thrown, why would we waste a bunch of songs on one artist who isn’t Robyn?!
