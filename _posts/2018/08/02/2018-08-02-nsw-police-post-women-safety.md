The NSW Police Force, known for their usually witty social media antics, has sparked backlash after posting their version of Beyoncé’s ‘Single Ladies’ to their Facebook page in which it instructs women on how to stay safe on, presumably, Tinder dates.

The post reads:

>Up on your phone, surfing apps alone,
>Doing your own little thing,
>You’ve decided to swipe, have a super like,
>Now someone’s asking to meet,
>Keep yourself safe (safe),
>Tell a friend your meeting place (place),
>‘Cause it’s only worth it if you’re okay,
>You can’t be playing with safety.

The post has garnered a wide reaction with over 10,000 people reacting to it on Facebook. Though some users found the lyrics humorous, others immediately accused the Police Force of victim-blaming.

One user wrote: “Hey NSW police, maybe women would be safer if you concentrated on prosecuting male perpetrators of violence, supported and believed female survivors of violence, and put appropriate resources and training into prevent[ing] men’s violence as core business.” 

Another wrote: “Maybe you can do a catchy song about consent while you’re at it.” 

A number of comments just read “Victim-blaming 101”. 

In June 2018, Victoria Police Detective Inspector Andrew Stamper was accused of victim-blaming after saying “people need to be aware of their own personal security and just be mindful of their surroundings.”

Stamper had been speaking at a press conference relating to the alleged rape and murder of 22-year-old Melbourne women, Eurydice Dixon. 

As revealed by Dixon’s partner, the rising comedian had been aware of her surroundings and had sent a final text message to her partner reading “I’m almost home safe, HBU”.
