Is Beyonce the new Carrie Bradshaw?

Last week in the south of France, Mrs. Carter stepped off a yacht wearing a pair of oversized diamond hoop earrings, the right one emblazoned with her name. They were crafted by Messika, which also created a custom version of its diamond “Move Addiction” earrings — a collaboration with Gigi Hadid — that Queen Bey has been wearing onstage during her current OTR II tour.

“It seems we have a special relationship,” says Valerie Messika, jewelry designer and founder of the Paris-based brand. “It really is very spontaneous. This is a woman who could choose anything she wanted, so I’m surprised and touched anytime she wears any of our pieces.”

Nameplate and personalized jewelry has been a favorite among stars and stylish girls since Sarah Jessica Parker sported her iconic “Carrie” necklace on Sex and the City. Gold nameplate chokers were seen in February on Dior’s Fall/Winter 2018 runway, while Bella Hadid and Kaia Gerber also recently have been spotted wearing nameplate necklaces. Unsurprisingly, Beyoncé's hoops are next-level: The one-of-a-kind earrings took five months to craft in Messika’s Paris atelier and feature 4.97 carats of white diamonds set in 18-karat white gold. Look closer to notice the delicate accent over the second E in her name, as well as a trio of floating diamonds in the O: Stones in motion are a signature of Messika and its Move collection, and in this case are meant to represent Blue Ivy, Rumi and Sir, Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s three children.

“I wanted to create something that felt special and symbolized motherhood,” Messika explains. “I also love that she wore them with something really casual. That’s exactly what I had in my mind when I launched my brand.”
