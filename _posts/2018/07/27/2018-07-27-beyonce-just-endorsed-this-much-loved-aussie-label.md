To say 2018 has been a spectacular year for Bondi-born fashion label Camilla. While its popular founder Camilla Franks may be battling one of the hardest years to date on a personal level following a shock cancer diagnosis, the birth of her first child followed by the epic success of her brand’s closing show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia would be hard to beat.

That said, the most famous woman in the world wearing Camilla not once but three times over the past week while on holiday with her family in Europe must surely be the metaphorical gold-dipped cherry on top.

In another photo, Beyoncé wears a bright one-piece swimsuit from the Spring Summer 2018 Geisha collection showcased in one of the most visually sublime shows ever seen in Australian fashion week history.

While this exact print is no longer available, you can shop the bikini version: The briefs cost $59 and bikini top $129. Another one-piece in the same print but a different blue-based colourway is also available here – although we suspect it won’t be for long. Just call it The Carter Effect…
