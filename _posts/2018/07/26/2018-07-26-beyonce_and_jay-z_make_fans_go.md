Not often during his career has Jay-Z played second fiddle.

He held his own on the mic with the Notorious B.I.G. He went toe-to-toe with Nas. Jay-Z's been featured on tracks by Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, Linkin Park, Mariah Carey and Eminem.

But with the "On the Run II Tour," Jay-Z knows his role. The star of the show is his wife Beyoncé, something the crowd at FirstEnergy Stadium on Wednesday night wouldn't dare argue.

That's not to say Hov wasn't great. He's a star of the highest caliber. But the crowd hung on Beyoncé's every move. And who could blame them? She strutted, twerked, rapped and flipped her hair like the pop queen she (and everyone else) knows she is.

Right from the start, Beyoncé and Jay-Z went for something epic. "This is real life," the giant LED screen read at the onset of the performance. What followed was a series of videos telling the story of struggling lovers trying to find their way back to each other.

It was performance art that reflects the ups and downs of the biggest couple in music. But those things are in the past. Jay and Bey showcased a ton of chemistry during their show and gave a masterclass in oozing star power.

The crowd roared as the opening chords to "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" rang out. Beyoncé continuously upped the ante, bringing out dancers for an awesome choreography session during "Drunk In Love."

Cameras followed Beyoncé around the stage, which featured to lengthy runways. At times, it caused the show to lack intimacy. It felt more like you were watching an HBO special than feeding off the energy of a stadium show. To his credit, Jay-Z brought things back to reality time and time again.
