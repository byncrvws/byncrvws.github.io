Beyoncé will be on the cover of Vogue’s September issue, fashion sources told Page Six.

The singer was on the cover of the vaunted September issue in 2015, and has been on the cover of other Vogue issues in 2009 and 2013.

We hear the photographer will be Tyler Mitchell.

In 2015, Mario Testino photographed Beyoncé, but Vogue did not interview the icon, who has increasingly controlled her image.

Meanwhile, rumors continue to swirl that the issue could be Anna Wintour’s last.

Reported WWD this month: “Numerous industry sources have insisted in recent weeks that Wintour is indeed set to leave her 30-year post as editor-in-chief of American Vogue, with the reveal of a soft exit thought to be coming after the all-important September issue.” Condé Nast has vehemently denied the rumors.
