There are quite a few celebrity Bengals fans. There’s Nick Lachey, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney, Denzel Washington and comedian Gary Owens, to name a few.

But, adding Beyoncé to that list would be pretty awesome.

The star singer was photographed in a Bengals jersey this week, that of No. 9, Carson Palmer.

It’s unclear what this was for. It doesn’t seem natural, but, maybe!? Beyoncé was playing alongside her husband Jay Z in Cleveland this week. So maybe there was a pit stop or some promotion in Cincinnati, too. I surely hope she didn't show up at FirstEnergy Stadium, where the concert was, in that Bengals jersey.
