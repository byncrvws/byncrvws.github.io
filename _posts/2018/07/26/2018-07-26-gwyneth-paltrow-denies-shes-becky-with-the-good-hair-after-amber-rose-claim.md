Gwyneth Paltrow is shutting down Amber Rose‘s claim that she is the alleged mistress whom Beyoncé references in her Lemonade track, “Sorry.”

Rose recently named the Oscar-winning actress as the identity behind “Becky with the good hair,” the woman at the center of the JAY Z cheating rumors in April 2016 when Beyoncé released the latest solo album that contained many revelations of her marriage to the rapper.

However, a rep for Paltrow tells PEOPLE that Rose’s allegations are “completely absurd and 100 percent false.”

A source also adds, “Gwyneth and Beyoncé and JAY Z are still very close friends so none of this makes any sense.”

“It was literally a joke on a podcast!” says a source close to Rose. “She was only kidding.”

Rose made the joke during the latest episode of Spencer and Heidi Pratt’s podcast, Make Speidi Famous Again, telling The Hills couple, “I definitely think that Gwyneth Paltrow is ‘Becky with the good hair.’ I really feel like she’s the one who was, like, f—ing JAY Z.”
