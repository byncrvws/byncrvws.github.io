Beyonce has sparked even more rumours that she's pregnant with baby number four.

Fans are convinced that the star and her husband Jay Z are expecting another child.

The couple already share daughter Blue Ivy, six, and twins Sir and Rumi, one, but if fans are right, they could be adding to their brood very soon.

Bey and Jay are currently touring together with their On The Run II show, and a video of Beyonce doing her thing in Rome has prompted even more rumours that she's expecting.

As she stands front and centre in a sequined dress singing their hit Bonnie & Clyde, fans became convinced she was with child.

And as the song finished, she placed one hand protectively on her belly and rubbed it, only adding fuel to the fire.

Fans took to Twitter to find out if it was true.
