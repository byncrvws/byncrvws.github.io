The Beyhive got buzzing about another pregnancy when footage of Beyonce performing in Paris over the weekend hit the internet Tuesday.

The mother of three, 36, performed in the French city in a skintight bodysuit. Eagle eyed fans shared videos and images of the singer onstage leading many to believe Beyonce just might be pregnant again.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">she pregnant pregnant <a href="https://t.co/JSlqi4YlAU">pic.twitter.com/JSlqi4YlAU</a></p>&mdash; iffy (@somalijawn) <a href="https://twitter.com/somalijawn/status/1019122395079172096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

And to make all the fuss seem even more legitimate, Beyonce sent fans into overdrive when one sharp Twitter user pointed out that she recently wore a shirt with "Carter 4" emblazoned across it.

However, the star has not said a word regarding the rumors. And to complicate matters even more another Twitter user observed that the "Crazy in Love" singer was also recently pictured with a bottle of beer next to her -- however, that by itself is proof of nothing.

The hitmaker shares daughter Blue Ivy, six, and twins Rumi and Sir, born in June 2017, with Jay-Z.
