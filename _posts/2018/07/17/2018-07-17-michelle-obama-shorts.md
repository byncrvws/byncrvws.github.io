It’s been one year, five months, and 26 days since President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama left the White House for the last time. While the rest of the world seemingly crumbles around us, the Obamas, as Michelle told talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, are adjusting well to life outside the spotlight. “The girls are good, Barack is working, we've got projects going, so we’re staying busy,” Obama said in February of what the family’s been up to. "We've had some fun."

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Michelle Obama checking out Beyoncé at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OTRII?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OTRII</a> in Paris?

But “we’ve had some fun” is putting it mildly. Now that Obama is out of the White House, she’s letting her hair down (literally) and flying all over the world — including a stop in Paris on Sunday for On The Run II. There, she took in Beyoncé and Jay-Z's performance from the side of the massive stage, dancing alongside Tina Knowles, Beyoncé’s mother. Her daughter, Sasha, was also in attendance. For the event, Obama wore a pair of drawstring high-waisted shorts and a white tank top under a voluminous white jacket. And though she looked like #goals, it didn’t take long for the detractors to, once again, compare her to current First Lady Melania Trump.
