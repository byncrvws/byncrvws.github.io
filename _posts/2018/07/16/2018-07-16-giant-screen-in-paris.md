Before we begin, a personal anecdote: In 2010 I was in Montreal attending a show by Jónsi of Sigur Rós at Metropolis in downtown MTL. Prior to the gig starting, all the TVs in the theatre were tuned into game two of the NHL Eastern Conference semifinals between Montreal’s own Canadiens and the Pittsburgh Penguins which was taking place in Pittsburgh. With around 3 minutes left in the final period, and with Montreal grimly holding on to a 3-1 lead (they would go on to win), the TVs were switched off in preparation for Jónsi’s set. To this day, I have never – in my life – heard a crowd boo anything louder.

The point here being: Sometimes musos are wise to recognise those rare occasions where sport trumps all.

To wit: Beyoncé and Jay-Z are currently swanning their way through Europe on the opening leg of their On The Run II world tour, with the latest destination being a set of two shows in Paris.

The second of their two shows happened to take place last night (Paris time) which also just-so-happened to be the day of the FIFA World Cup final, at which France would ultimately grasp global sporting glory.

Not only was their stop in the French epicentre, but it happened to be at the Stade de France; the home of the French national football team.
