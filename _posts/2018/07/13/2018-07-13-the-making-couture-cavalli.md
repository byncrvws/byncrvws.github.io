Beyoncé and Mariah Carey were back in Roberto Cavalli on stage this weekend – but unlike in 2014 when both divas wore the same embellished, black dress, this time they were dressed in custom-made designs by the Italian label’s new creative director Paul Surridge.

Carey kicked off her Las Vegas residency on July 5 in a couture Cavalli dress, while Beyoncé stepped out on July 6 in Milan in two custom-made creations for the latest leg of her OTR II Tour.

“I jumped at the opportunity,” Surridge tells Vogue of the chance to work with the two living icons. Both singers have worn the Italian label on and off the stage throughout their careers, but this was a chance for Surridge to reimagine them in his vision for the “new” Cavalli. “For me, the woman who wears Cavalli wants to be visible and wants to be celebrated,” says the British-born and Saint Martin’s-trained designer, who succeeded Peter Dundas at the helm of the Italian house in July 2017. “Both women represent very different things, but fundamentally they are both artists, both passionate and both beautiful women.”
