title: Beyoncé's genius move for Vogue
description: It took someone who sees the world from a different vantage point than, say, Anna Wintour to reportedly bring on a qualified and gifted African-American photographer -- who would be the first to shoot a cover in Vogue's 126-year history --thereby opening up perspective for all of us, writes Jill Filipovic.

Next month, Vogue's cover image is reportedly to be the magazine's first shot by a black photographer. Yes, the year is 2018, and never before has an image taken by a black person gotten cover billing in the nation's premier fashion magazine -- a publication that has been around for 126 years. 

We can't say that this is finally changing because higher-ups saw the light or even became embarrassed enough to shift course. The reason appears to lie elsewhere.

It's thanks to Beyoncé.

Beyoncé is the cover girl for Vogue's 2018 September issue, the most important book put out all year. And Bey, bless her, reportedly requested that her cover photo be taken by Tyler Mitchell, a 23-year-old Atlanta artist who told the New York Times that he "depict[s] black people and people of color in a really real and pure way." He brings, he said, "an honest gaze to my photos."

This is the power of diversity and representation: In the best of circumstances, it begets not just more diversity, but more creativity and innovation; it widens the perspective for all of us.

When most of the cultural kingmakers come from the same backgrounds, live in the same cities, run in the same crowds, and consume the same art and cultural artifacts, their own vision narrows. It becomes self-perpetuating. This trickles down to all the rest of us who rely on venerable, authoritative (we think) publications to highlight the best in fashion, culture and aesthetics.
When we widen the aperture, we grow.

Of course, members of racial and other minorities are not obligated to be perfect representations of their group, nor to use their positions to elevate others who have been similarly excluded or pushed to the margins. But it's great when they do.
