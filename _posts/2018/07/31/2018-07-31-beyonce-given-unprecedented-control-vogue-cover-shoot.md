Beyoncé has reportedly hired the first ever black photographer to shoot a cover for Vogue after being given unprecedented control over its September issue.

The magazine's editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, has handed the singer songwriter full control over the cover shoot as well as any photographs of her published inside the magazine and their captions, according to reports.

Beyoncé has used the opportunity to hire Tyler Mitchell, the first black photographer to shoot a cover in the publication’s 126-year history, the Huffington Post reported.

Wintour usually hires highly experienced fashion photographers and is not likely to have selected the 23-year-old fledgling photographer herself, according to sources. 

It is a sign of the award-winning musician's influence - Wintour, who was mythologised in the 2003 novel The Devil Wears Prada, is notorious for exerting full editorial control over the publication.

The fashion Bible's cover subjects are usually given little to no input over their photographs, which they are sent around a week before it hits the news stand.
