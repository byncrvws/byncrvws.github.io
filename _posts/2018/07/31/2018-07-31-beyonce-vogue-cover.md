Who runs the world? Beyoncé, apparently.
But you already knew that.

The superstar singer is reportedly not only going to be on the September cover of Vogue, but has used her star power to get the publication to hire its first black cover photographer in the magazine's 126-year history.

According to Huffington Post, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has given Beyoncé "unprecedented control" over her photographs and the captions, all of which the singer will write.

Oh, and unlike most every other cover subject, Queen Bey will not be sitting for an interview.

CNN has reached out to reps for the singer for comment.

The news that's buzzing the Beyhive most is that Beyoncé has selected 23-year-old Tyler Mitchell for the project -- and the fact that it's taken so long for a black photographer to get the coveted cover shoot.

>Beyoncé hiring a 23 year old black photographer for her Vogue cover, making him the first black photographer to shoot for vogue in 126 years!!! Is what we should ALL strive to do when given the opportunity to put someone else on and change the status quo!

>126 years and in 2018 Vogue is having the first Black photographer shoot their cover. Because Beyoncè said so. A Queen. Also Vogue is a mess.

>Beyoncé? The third Black woman to ever cover Vogue's most coveted (September) issue? Covering it again? And hiring its first black photographer? I'm not surprised. Nothing but respect for my president who continues to break barriers. pic.twitter.com/oZvYtawK0l

It's not the first time the star has used her influence to foster conversation about race and culture.

In 2016, her 56-minute long "Lemonade" visual album had listeners and Billboard hailing it as "a revolutionary work of black feminism."

Her brave response to me made me feel a-bit selfish and ashamed. She said i have worked very hard to get to the point where i have a true voice and At this point in my life and my career i have a responsibility to do whats best for the world and not what is most popular “ She said that her hope is that after the show young people would research this culture and see how cool it is, and young people black and white would listen to “ LIFT EVERY VOICE AND SING and see how amazing the words are for us all and bridge the gap. She also hopes that it will encourage young kids to enroll in our amazing HIstorically Black Colleges and Universities . I stand corrected ❤️</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A post shared by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mstinalawson/?utm_source=ig_embed" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;" target="_blank"> Tina Knowles</a> (@mstinalawson) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2018-04-16T17:46:39+00:00">Apr 16, 2018 at 10:46am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>
