BEYONCE has hit fans with surprise drops of her last three albums — but her next one might not be such a shock.

The superstar has already completed much of her seventh solo record, just weeks after the disappointing reception of Everything Is Love, her joint release with husband Jay-Z.

She has been quietly filming several clips for the visual project — basically a collection of music videos — and is planning to shoot another at the ruins of the Colosseum in Rome.

And while 2016’s Lemonade premiered on US telly network HBO, this time she is hoping to raise the bar by going with Netflix.

A source close to the singer said: “Beyonce has been hard at work on her next solo album and it is shaping up well.

“She wants it to be even more ground-breaking and visually impressive than Lemonade, which is why she is scouting out locations which will really wow people.
