What’s better than shooting a music video in the Louvre museum, one of the most iconic museums in the world?

Well, if your name is Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter, the next logical step is taking over an ancient landmark. Duh.

According to the Italian newspaper Il Messaggero, Bey applied for a permit to film at the Colosseum in Rome earlier this month, but was turned down because it was already booked (and it was too short a notice).

However, because she didn’t become Queen Bey by giving up, Beyoncé resubmitted her request and it is currently under review.

If approved, this would be Bey’s second time filming in the "Colosseo," as it’s called by the locals. Back in 2004 she teamed up with Britney Spears and Pink to film a Gladiator-themed Pepsi commercial in the massive iconic, stadium.
