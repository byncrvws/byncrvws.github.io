The superstar couple are enjoying a well-earned break in Capri before resuming their On The Run II joint tour.

Despite performing together most nights over the last few weeks, the lovebirds clearly aren't sick of each other, as Beyoncé cuddled up to Jay in among the bubbles.

The 36-year-old sat on her spouses lap while wearing a colourful swimsuit and a wide-brimmed coral pink hat to protect her from the sun.

Jay, 48, looked perfectly content with his superstar wife lying on him, as he draped his arms along the edge of the jacuzzi while wearing a black baseball cap.

The singers were then seen being served a drink by a member of staff while still immersed in the water, before being joined by one of their one-year-old daughter Rumi.
