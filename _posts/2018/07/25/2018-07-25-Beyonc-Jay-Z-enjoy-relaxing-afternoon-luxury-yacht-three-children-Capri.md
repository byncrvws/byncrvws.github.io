They've spent the summer darting around the world, their family in tow, performing their On The Run II joint tour.

But it was all about family time - and then alone time - for Beyoncé and Jay-Z on Tuesday, as they took to the seas around Capri, Italy, for a sun-drenched afternoon in the sunshine.

With their three children with them - Blue Ivy, six, and twins Rumi and Sir, one - the Carter family were seen hanging out by the on-board hot tub, and enjoying quality time as a family over lunch.
