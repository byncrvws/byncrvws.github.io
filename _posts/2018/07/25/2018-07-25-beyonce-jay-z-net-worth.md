This probably won't come as much of a shock to you, but Beyoncé and Jay-Z are very rich. Like, "I swim around in literal pools of money" rich. See? SEE?!

But have you ever taken a moment to daydream about just how much money Bey and Jay have in their (probably offshore, LOL, JK) bank accounts? Let's break down where all their dough comes from.

## Album and Single Sales

Beyoncé is the big winner when it comes to single sales, having (so far!) brought home $26 million in digital singles, while her husband has earned "just" $23 million. Aw. But Jay-Z trumps Bey when it comes to album sales: he's made an impressive $27.5 million, while Beyoncé has "only" made $13 million.

If you're surprised to learn that Jay's album sales exceed Bey's, consider the fact that his biggest hits came out well before digital streaming was really a *thing*—meaning it was more common for people to buy full albums. (Remember the days of browsing CDs at the mall?!) But that's just a theory. Either way, let's all take a moment to get in formation:

P.S. We also can't forget about the money Beyoncé made from her time as part of Destiny's Child! Sure, she was splitting earnings with Kelly and Michelle, but it's still fair to assume she made a lot of $$.

## Touring

Bey and Jay are currently deep into their On the Run II tour, which Billboard projects will make $200 million. Their first (much shorter) On the Run tour reportedly earned $5 million per show, grossing a total of $95 million. Jay's 2017 4:44 tour grossed $48.7 million, and Beyoncé had the highest-grossing tour of 2016, earning $256 million. Like...HOW DOES THAT MUCH MONEY EVEN EXIST ON PLANET EARTH? BRB, taking a moment to fan myself:
