Beyoncé has reportedly almost completed the follow-up to her visual LP Lemonade.

The 36-year-old megastar only released her joint album with husband Jay-Z, Everything Is Love, a little over a month ago. She is believed to have been secretly penning songs and shooting videos for the new project, which has already caught the attention of Netflix.

An insider told The Sun newspaper’s Bizarre column: “Beyoncé has been hard at work on her next solo album, and it is shaping up well. She wants it to be even more ground-breaking and visually impressive than Lemonade, which is why she is scouting out locations which will really wow people.”

According to the tabloid, the “Halo” singer is to record footage at the Colosseum in Rome, Italy, among other places.

“Her team is now in negotiations with Netflix to premiere the project, which would introduce it to a massive audience,” The Sun reported.

The subscription service put in a huge offer for Lemonade in 2016, but due to the “Crazy in Love” hitmaker’s contracts with HBO and her rapper spouse’s streaming service Tidal, they were unable to seal the deal. Netflix, however, is hoping to tempt Beyoncé with even more money this time.

The source close to the star added: “They offered a seven-figure sum for Lemonade, but contractual obligations with HBO and Tidal meant it didn’t happen. But they are willing to pay through the roof this time because Beyoncé still has massive pulling power.”

The Destiny’s Child star recently dined at La Petite Maison in Nice, France, with her mother Tina Knowles Lawson. U2’s Bono and Sir Elton John were also there, which means they could be set to write a song  together in the coming days for Disney’s planned remake of The Lion King now that her schedule is clear until next July 25 when the U.S. leg of Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s “On The Run II Tour” kicks off.
