title: Celebs Like Jennifer Garner and Beyoncé Have More Than One Job
description: Sure, you know them as larger-than-life personalities on screen and in gossip mags. But many celebrities have interests—and jobs—outside the entertainment industry.

Sure, you know them as larger-than-life personalities on screen and in gossip mags. But many celebrities have interests—and jobs—outside the entertainment industry. Soul singer/songwriter Erykah Badu, for instance, has assisted at more than 40 births in her role as a certified doula (childbirth coach). Singer Patti LaBelle is also a pie maven, whose sweet potato pie was such a hit for Walmart in 2015 that she expanded the line to include three fruit cobblers and an apple pecan cake. Or consider:

## Nick Offerman, carpentry

The comedian/actor (Parks and Recreation) is a serious woodworker, with a shop in east L.A. that sells everything from benches to canoes. He’s written articles extolling the virtues of plywood, a book about the joys of woodworking (Good Clean Fun), and starting July 31 he’ll co-host Making It on NBC with Amy Poehler, a crafting competition show. “Woodworking is not like penicillin—you don’t get dumped, go build a chair, and then your life feels better,” Offerman once told Vanity Fair. “But it’s not far off…for years, when auditioning for big jobs frustrated me, I always found a great deal of solace in my shop.” 

## Jennifer Garner, baby food

The mom of three co-founded Once Upon a Farm in 2017. Its headquarters: the Garner family farm in Locust Grove, Oklahoma, where Garner’s mom grew up and home-grown blueberries, kale, persimmons and other produce go straight into the company’s baby food line. Garner, a self-described “picky eater” as a kid, says her mom fed her only homemade food—a tradition she strives to continue with kids Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6. Between making films (her vigilante justice flick Peppermint comes out September 7), serving as an artist ambassador and Trustee for Save the Children, fulfilling her role as Brand Ambassador for Once Upon a Farm, and raising her own family, Garner’s days are packed. But she’s “passionate about childhood nutrition and leaving a healthier and happier planet for the next generation.”
