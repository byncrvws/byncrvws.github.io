Investing in liquor companies has been lucrative for a long list of celebs, but Oprah Winfrey's recent decision to back the rising True Food Kitchen restaurant chain reflects a slightly different A-List trend: Chomping into the food and dining businesses.

<iframe title="USATODAY- Embed Player" style="width: 100%;" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://uw-media.usatoday.com/video/embed/36785999?placement=embed"></iframe>

The media mogul said in a statement that she took a stake because she wanted to "be part of the company's future." She will serve as a collaborator and consultant to expand the health-oriented restaurant chain across the U.S., the company announced.

Winfrey joins a long list of household names, from Beyonce to Ashton Kutcher, who have put their money where their celebrity mouths are in recent years, backing everything from protein substitute companies to online grocery stores and “healthy” beverage manufacturers.

They follow in the footsteps of past Hollywood stars like Paul Newman, the late actor whose pasta sauces and other products still grace supermarket shelves with profits going to charity, or country crooner Jimmy Dean, whose sausage brand outlives him.

Flush with income from their starring roles, celebrities invest in the food or restaurant trade to leverage their fame and hedge against upheaval in the entertainment business that is making their big salaries less dependable. Consider that U.S. box office revenue dropped 2.7 percent from 2016 to 2017 fans continued to shun theaters and gravitate to streaming services at home like Netflix. 

Though U.S. music industry revenue has edged up slightly in recent years, total album sales has been on the decline since 2007. The drop is attributed mostly to the rise in streaming services, but apps like YouTube, Apple Music and Spotify pay musicians as little as a penny per stream.

"In the past celebrities could make enough money by securing a movie or a record deal," said Jeetendr Sehdev, celebrity branding authority and author of "The Kim Kardashian Principle." "Now it’s harder to make money that way. So, they might seek back-end endorsements and investments in business."

Plus, they often score sweet deals from developers or business partners who know how celebrity cache will elevate their otherwise forgettable brands.

"It's very likely that these companies give better deals to celebrities," said Bruce Turkel, brand consultant and author of "All about Them: Grow Your Business by Focusing on Others." 

In addition to perks, experts say that some celebrities will invest in food to keep up with the "in" crowd.

"People tend to spend time with people who are like them. It's very likely that these celebrities hang out with other celebrities. They see what one another is doing and they do it," Turkel said. 

While it's common for people to fund companies they suspect will produce a return, there are other drivers that can motivate stars to invest, like branding opportunities. 

"It is critical for celebrities to invest in their brands," Sehdev said. "Whether it's Madonna and Vita CoCo or Bey and Jay Z going vegan, taking an equity stake allows them to come across as being authentic."
