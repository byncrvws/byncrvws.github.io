They are set to embark on the American leg of their On The Run II tour next week. 

And Beyonce and Jay-Z made the most of their time off as they sunned themselves while relaxing on a luxury yacht on the Amalfi Coast, Italy on Saturday. 

The American singer, 36, showed off her busty cleavage in a plunging bikini and semi-sheer cover-up as she indulged in conversation with her rapper other half, 48.

The If I Were A Boy hitmaker looked sensational as she embraced summer chic for the day on board the vessel.

Looking every inch the fashionista, the star clad her famous curves in a flowing semi-sheer cover-up.
