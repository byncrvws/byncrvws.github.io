Jay-Z and Beyonce are reportedly trying to rent the Roman Colosseum.

Bey filed a request with the local government to rent out the Italian landmark on July 7 and 8, which would have overlapped with the Rome stop of their ‘On The Run II’ tour, according to Italian newspaper Il Messaggero.

The request was apparently denied, with the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage stating that Italian scientist Alberto Angela had already reserved the space.

The Ministry also noted that the request was made on short notice, and that the Colosseum is, as one might imagine, a “very complicated place.”

But Beyoncé has since filed a new request which is still under review although no dates as to when the couple plan to stay there have yet been revealed.

The couple recently screened the World Cup final at the Stade De France during one of their concerts earlier this month.
