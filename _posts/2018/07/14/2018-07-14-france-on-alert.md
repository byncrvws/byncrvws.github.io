Beyonce and Jay-Z are just two of the millions of people under a massive security umbrella in France this weekend that’ll peak with the World Cup final.

Some 110,000 police officers are deploying across the nation for Bastille Day celebrations on Saturday, when a military parade on the Champs-Elysees in Paris, fireworks at the Eiffel Tower and balls in many cities mark France’s main national holiday. On the capital’s outskirts, the two American superstars will perform at the 81,000-seat Stade de France soccer stadium.

On Sunday, soccer fans throughout France will be rooting for the national team to take its first World Cup trophy in 20 years in the final against Croatia. If the French win, the team would return to Paris on Monday for a victory parade on the Champs-Elysees that would probably draw more than 1 million fans.

“We couldn’t mobilize more forces than we will mobilize this weekend,” French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told reporters on Friday. “At this time, we will mobilize all of our forces.”

Most of the biggest betting firms and exchanges in the U.K., Ireland and beyond are placing a 65 percent or better chance on France winning the World Cup.

About 12,000 police officers will be in action in Paris, from anti-riot units to plainclothes officers patrolling the streets of the capital. Military patrols, which have been protecting sensitive sites against terrorist attacks for several years, will be beefed up. Medics and 44,000 firefighters will be mobilized, too. Two Tour de France stages also are scheduled this weekend.
