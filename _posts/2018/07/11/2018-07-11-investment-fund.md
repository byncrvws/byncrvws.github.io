A new investment fund backed by song royalties has revealed that huge hits by Justin Bieber, Beyonce and Rihanna will form part of its first catalog.

Hipgnosis Songs Fund, which was listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) on Wednesday, plans to build a portfolio of songs that generate a long-term income stream.

Following the listing, the company revealed that it has acquired a 75 percent interest in its first music rights catalog from musician Terius Youngdell Nash, better known as The-Dream. Included in the 302-song collection are Justin Bieber’s smash hit “Baby,” Rihanna’s “Umbrella” and Beyonce’s “Single Ladies.”

Hipgnosis is to pay $23.75 million for the stake.

The investment vehicle was founded by Merck Mercuriadis, the former manager of internationally renowned acts such as Elton John, Guns ’n’ Roses, Iron Maiden and Beyonce.

He told CNBC’s Tanya Bryer on Wednesday that the fund will immediately spend £70 million ($92.7 million) of the initial £200 million raised, with the entirety to be invested in songs within nine months. Mercuriades said he wanted to then return to capital markets with an aim to balloon the fund to a £1 billion value.

“At £1 billion, we will be 18 or 19 percent of global publishing. At that point, we will have the critical mass to effect the change,” he added.

Mercuriades said he believed his firm would be able to squeeze more value from a song as the world of streaming continued to grow. He added that a songwriter who doesn’t perform or sell merchandise could particularly benefit.

“If you are a songwriter and you are making $2 or $3 million a year and you are at that place where you need to get a check for $30 million, this is the only thing that gets you there,” he said.
