She's been the subject of much speculation recently, with fans questioning if she is secretly pregnant with her fourth child. 

Yet Beyonce continued to ignore the rumours as she enjoyed a relaxing yacht trip with husband Jay Z in Nice, France on Tuesday, whilst concealing her figure in a loose T-shirt ahead of the North American leg of their joint On the Run II world tour. 

The 36-year-old songstress, who gave birth to twins Rumi and Sir in June last year, and is also mother to daughter Blue Ivy, six, seemed in good spirits on the outing, as the couple took advantage of some downtime just hours before taking to the stage for their performance at Allianz Riviera - the last of their European tour dates.

Keeping her physique under wraps, the Best Thing I Never Had hitmaker donned a loose-fitting T-shirt, that was branded with her husband's face and promoted his music company Tidal's collaboration with rock band, Sonic Youth.
