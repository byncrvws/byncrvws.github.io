Beyonce, Jay-Z, Ed Sheeran and Chris Martin will perform at the first Global Citizen Festival to be held in Africa to mark 100 years since the birth of Nelson Mandela.

Fans will be able to earn entry to the free ticketed concert at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on December 2 through volunteer work.

The event, hosted by Naomi Campbell, Sir Bob Geldof, Forest Whitaker, Gayle King and Tyler Perry, is the culmination of international advocacy organisation Global Citizen's Mandela 100 campaign, a series of events to honour the life of the former South African leader.

Usher, Pharrell Williams and Eddie Vedder will also perform.

The first Global Citizen festival was held in New York's Central Park in 2012 and Alicia Keys is due to play at the upcoming event in the city on September 29.
