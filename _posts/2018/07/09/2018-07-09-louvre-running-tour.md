The Carters have now inspired a visitor trail of the Louvre Museum in Paris, following the recent release of their video for new track Apesh**, which was set in the world famous art gallery.

The tour picks out the world-famous artworks featured in the video, which has been praised for its critique on underrepresentation of BAME artists and subjects in Western art history.

The suggested route, which has appeared on the Louvre’s website, takes in artworks including the Winged Victory of Samothrace – a marble statue in front of which Beyoncé is seen dancing in a billowing white dress – and the Mona Lisa by Leonardo, before finishing with Portrait of a Black Woman by Marie-Guillemine Benoist.

The route is available online for gallery goers and hip-hop fans to follow at their leisure, or visitors can choose to join tours running for four days each week.
